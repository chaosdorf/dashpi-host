# dashpi-host

This repository contains some configuration files for [dashpi](https://wiki.chaosdorf.de/Host:Dashpi).

Currently, this isn't really usable.

At some point in the future, this will expand.

We're running this setup on a Raspberry Pi with Alpine in diskless mode.

Requires ansible collection `community.general` which can be installed by
running: `ansible-galaxy collection install community.general`
